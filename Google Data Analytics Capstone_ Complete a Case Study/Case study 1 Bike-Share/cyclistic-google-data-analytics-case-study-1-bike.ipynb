The director of marketing believes the company’s future `success` depends on `maximizing the number of annual memberships`. Therefore, your\nteam `wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently`. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy `to convert casual riders into annual members`. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Characters and teams\n\n- `Cyclistic`: A `bike-share program` that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. \n\n- `Lily Moreno`: The `director` of marketing and your `manager`. Moreno is `responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program`. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n- `Cyclistic marketing analytics team`: A `team of data analysts` who are `responsible` for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n\n- `Cyclistic executive team`: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will `decide whether to approve the\nrecommended marketing program`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the company\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: `single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships`. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. \n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have `concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders`. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, `Moreno believes that ` `maximizing` the number of annual members will be key to `future growth`. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, `Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members`. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. \n\n<b> Moreno has set a clear goal: </b>\n\n- Design marketing strategies aimed at `converting casual riders into annual members`. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand `how annual members and casual riders differ`, `why casual riders would buy a membership`, and `how digital media could affect their marketing tactics`. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Roadmap For Data Analysis Process\n<img src = 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R04kRGnrDkkbLOKhuZT_lB73Bv_nt_TC99VxOywWQnSz3_54EkXg_dDyGdlnFXiE37F6Rz2ulPump6xdxqOPprHCuCPaqmh6-5X6psfS_SEHEjhgzwzon1HAV4_0DJZwtF66c9mx=w945-h600-p-k-no-nu'>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Three questions will guide the future marketing program:\n1.

This is based on the observation that the number of rides is fairly consistent day over day as is the average ride duration.\n\nConversely, casual user rentals are lower Monday through Thursday and trend upwards starting on Friday and peaking on the weekend.\n\nThis seems to indicate using the bikes for leisure activities such as touring the city, sightseeing, etc. Additional data that supports this is the longer average ride duration. \n\n#### My three recommendations for the new marketing strategy are as follows:\n\n1. Offer a weekend-only membership at a different price point than the full annual membership to entice casual users towards a full annual membership. They can only unlock bikes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.\n2. Create a \"See our City\" campaign targeted to casual users that includes 52 suggested routes that will cover all of the major sights in Chicago---one for each weekend. Casual riders could rent as they go, but they could see their city in one year (and save money!) for the price of an annual membership.\n3. Be sure that any campaigns are out to the market in the summer when ridership is at its annual peak.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### `Note:`  it needes to be improve because my analysis is not completed yet. \n\nreference for some helpl: https://www.kaggle.com/codyfreeman/code\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you for Reading it if you want to reach me please refer to:\n- <a href='https://github.com/nijatullahmansoor'>Github</a>\n- <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/feed/'>Linkedin</a>\n- <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/nijatullahmansoor'>Kaggle</a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
